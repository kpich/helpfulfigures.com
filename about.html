<div class="ab_about">
  <p>This site is a collection of informative and helpful visual representations of different types of information.</p>
  <p>Some of this site uses HTML 5 Canvas elements, which I don't believe currently work on Internet Explorer. Further, I don't guarantee all of these things work on mobile devices. They will almost certainly work on Firefox, Desktop Safari, Chrome, and Opera though.</p>
  <p>Let it be forthwith stated that everything on this site is quite obviously fake and, further, quite obviously parodic! So don't sue me.</p>
  <p>The site itself is built with <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> and makes some use of <a href="http://processingjs.org/">Processing.js</a>. You can see the entirety of the site's "source" <a href="http://github.com/kpich/helpfulfigures.com">here</a>.</p>
